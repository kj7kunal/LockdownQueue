Description
A regular visit to the grocery store in these trying and troubling times involves boring, stressful, and panic-ridden queues. Moreover, despite enduring this ordeal, many customers are left bereft of essentials. We believe that there is a solution to this problem! Our main idea is to have a listing of nearby stores on our web based app, where people can buy what they please. If the option of home delivery exists, they may very well avail it. Understanding that this is not always possible, we then introduce the idea of a virtual queue. The idea is to associate a QR code to each order which acts as your place in a queue. It defines for you a timeframe within which you may visit the store and collect your placed order. While there, you may also shop for any other items you please. By clearly demarcating times, we avoid overcrowding. By placing suitable limitations on how much can be bought via the app, we are able to discourage hoarding, and also provide incentives for sensitive age groups such as senior citizens. We believe that this app is a step in the right direction for a safer and stress-free shopping experience!
